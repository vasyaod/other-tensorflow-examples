1. https://github.com/vasyaod/other-tensorflow-examples/blob/master/ex1.py

This is hybrid of two examples for two different projects:
 - https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/examples/3_NeuralNetworks/multilayer_perceptron.py
 - https://pythonhosted.org/neurolab/ex_newff.html  

But with without any data reading of MINST and batch teaching. Quite simple for the begin.
